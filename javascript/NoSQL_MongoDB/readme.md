I made this using node and ejs. The url is http://hw2emrah.herokuapp.com/
When you click the url. You see 3 options which are "add user", "delete user"
and "login as a user".

Add User: when you want to add user, you must write only 1 word to specify User
otherwise it reject and does not create any user.

Delete user: just click a user name and press the button to delete any user.
Deleded user's all inventions are deleted also.

A LÄ±gin As a User: choose one user and click the button. In user mode, you can see
user name, total rating avg rating and  3 options.
These 3 options are exibit user, drop invention and rate envention.

exibit user: to create invention, fill the needed parts. most of options of new invention can be empty
but product name must be filled otherwise reject to create invention.

Drop invention: in this part, it shows inventions owned by the user who login. you can select one of the inventions
and click the drop button. This process does not delete the product but make it passive i.e no users can see the invention
even owned user.

Rate invention: You can rate all active inventions. A user can rate own invention. If you want to rate a invention
more than 1 times, your rate is updated not added.
